about Global Interpreter Lock in python.  
[korean version](https://puffy-juice-530.notion.site/GIL-1abe85f656be4af18db19f98c99e0e0e)

- **what is the GIL?**    
    - Global Interpreter Lock is a mutex that allows only one thread to hold the control of the python interpreter  

- **how does python works?**
    1. interpreter is loaded in memory
    2. python code is run through interpreter

- **python's memory management**
    - python object's creation and destruction is managed through reference count
    - refcount is attribute that object have and keeps track of the number of refrence that point to object
    - when refcount reaches to zero, the memory occupied by the object is released.

- **why use GIL?**
    - this reference count variable needed protection from **race conditions** where two threads increase or decrease its value simultaneously, so always lock when increase or decrease refcount.  
    but python is everythng consist of object so inefficient.

        **Therefore python is using GIL.**

- **advance**
    - generally using multiprocessing modules about asynchronous problem.  
    but there is somthing special about CPU usage.
    this part will be updated later.
